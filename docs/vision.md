# Atlas – Vision

Atlas exists to bring practical intelligence into real-world work.

Most AI systems today are cloud-dependent, passive, and disconnected from physical reality.
Atlas is built differently.

## Core Beliefs
- Intelligence should work where people work
- Systems must function even without internet
- AI should guide, not replace, human skill
- Safety and learning are foundational, not optional

## Long-Term Direction
Atlas is designed as a modular platform that can support multiple real-world domains over time, including:
- Workplace safety
- Technical training
- Infrastructure operations
- Health and field services

These domains will be approached step by step, starting with focused, practical deployments.

## Build Philosophy
- Edge-first, cloud-optional
- Privacy by default
- Incremental capability growth
- Real-world constraints respected

Atlas prioritizes reliability, clarity, and usefulness over scale or hype.
